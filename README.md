# RobotMaze: Discrete Event Simulation Model for Robot Navigation

## Project Overview

**RobotMaze** is a project focused on developing a discrete event simulation model for automated design systems. The goal is to investigate the effectiveness of various pathfinding algorithms (A*, Fuzzy Logic, Ant Colony Optimization) in a maze environment with obstacles and stochastic factors. The project includes:
- Maze generation and robot initialization.
- Rendering of the maze and robots.
- Event handling and user interaction.
- Implementation of pathfinding algorithms and robot movement.
- Time and event management.

The project is developed in C# using WPF for the graphical user interface.
